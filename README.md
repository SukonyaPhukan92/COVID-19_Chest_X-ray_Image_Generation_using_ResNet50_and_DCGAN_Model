# COVID-19_Chest_X-ray_Image_Generation_using_ResNet50_and_DCGAN_Model


This repository provides codes with datasets for the generation of synthesis images of Covid-19 Chest X-ray using DCGAN as generator and ResNet50 as discriminator from a set of raw covid-19 chest x-ray images, which are enhanced and segmented before passing through the DCGAN model.

# **Step 1: Image Enhancement**

The folder named ***1. Image Enhancement*** contains following contents 
1. code file (in .ipynb format) of covid-19 Chest X-ray image enhancement using Histogram Equalization techinque.
2. Sample of input of the above mentioned code (i.e. Covid-19 Chest X-ray raw grayscale images)
2. Sample of output of the above mentioned code (i.e. Covid-19 Chest X-ray enhanced images)
